## Expectations

In Phase 0 you need to:

1. familiarise yourself with the learning culture we foster at Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA), and
2. build the foundation of skills and understanding we require of students on bootcamp.


## Expectations

EDA is not a traditional school.
- We require you to show up with [Integrity, Kindness and Effort](#show-up-with-integrity-kindness-and-effort)
- We expect you to be here because you want to be here to become a web developer
- We expect you to take responsibility for your own learning, which includes:
  - Being open and honest about things you are finding difficult
  - Tracking your own progress
  - Reaching out when you have questions or need help
  - Communicate with us if there are circumstances that will effect your ability to keep up with the assignments
- We expect you to constructively engage with your cohort
- We expect you to complete all core assignments to the best of your ability by bootcamp
- We expect you to strive for understanding
- We **do not** expect 100% working solutions
- We **do not** expect perfect understanding

EDA is fundamentally about **learning with a community**, and this community will provide the support and guidance you need to accomplish your goal. Phase 0 staff are only a small part of that community. **Your peers will be the main support you have during Phase 0**, and will continue to be a key part of your support through bootcamp. Phase 0 staff are also here to provide support; we just ask that you initiate the conversation.

The focus of the assignments is not 'the right answer' or the most perfect code. It is about your own honest, best attempt at tackling the challenge. Sometimes, your attempts will not even produce a working solution, and that is OK. If your solution ends up being 30 lines of pseudocode and you don't know where to begin, make a comment saying where you are stuck and submit it. Then you can reach out for more help (from other members of your cohort or from EDA staff) in order to complete the challenge.

In Phase 0, you can expect us to:
- kindly help you learn through and around difficult life events
- help facilitate engagement of everyone in your cohort
- help you overcome learning blocks **IF**:
  - you've already earnestly attempted to overcome the problem, read any error messages, googled, and reached out to your cohort
  - between the hours of 9:00 - 17:00, Monday to Friday

If you feel like we are not fulfilling these expectations, we really want to know - please talk to us on Slack or tell us via the weekly feedback forms.


## Show up with Integrity, Kindness and Effort

At EDA, we are asking you to do a crazy thing: learn how to be a web developer in a matter of weeks. For you to reach this goal, we need everyone to work together, follow our methodology, and agree to adhere to the rules and guidelines that have successfully served many EDA students before you.

We have three pillars that guide the actions of everyone in the EDA community (staff, students, and alumni). They are Integrity, Kindness and Effort. We expect every person to uphold these values every day, throughout the entirety of the programme. By enrolling in EDA, you are implicitly agreeing to uphold these agreements. **Failing to uphold these values will have negative impacts on your learning, and the learning of others in the programme**. If at any time you are not upholding any of these agreements, you will be asked to leave the program.

Please read about [The Three Pillars](/three-pillars/README.md).

## Looking for work

Until you have graduated, please don't try to look for work as a developer. This includes applying for internship programs like Summer of Tech. At the end of the bootcamp we run a careers week which will help launch you into the job market.
