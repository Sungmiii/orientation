# Tools you may use

Just as carpenters, surgeons, blacksmiths, and accountants need their tools, so do web developers.

The Enspiral Dev Academy course is very hands on. You'll be writing code almost from day one, and you'll be doing it using the same tools that professional web developers use.

1. [Terminal / the Command Line](./terminal/)
4. [Git and GitHub](./git-and-github/)
5. [Git and GitHub weekly workflow](./git-and-github/using-github-during-phase-0.md)
6. [Slack](./slack)
7. [Lints and validators](./lints-and-validators)
8. [Vagrant (optional)](./vagrant/) - you will use this if you choose to run the Dev Academy virtual machine
