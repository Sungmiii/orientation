# Changing cohorts or withdrawing

If need be, while in Phase-0 you may opt to delay the start date of your bootcamp (change cohorts).
Likewise if you are a bootcamp student and struggling with the material you may opt to repeat a module and or be instructed by EDA to repeat.

## Repeating / changing cohorts as a bootcamp student
Should you need to repeat a module, take note:

* You will need to submit all work again in your new cohort.
* You must re-do all challenges for the weeks you are repeating.
* EDA can ask a student to repeat if they have not met the expectations to a reasonable standard.
* EDA reserves the right to restrict the number of times a student repeats a phase.
* You will need to complete the [change of cohort form](http://goo.gl/forms/WHZK8bbvlK)

If repeating is an option you want to explore more, please talk to your facilitator. Remember that there may be a wait before the next cohort starts, so take that into consideration when making your decision. We recognise that students make significant sacrifices and rearrange their lives in order to make study work, so we do try to avoid roll backs wherever possible.


## Deferring to a Later Cohort

If now is not a good time to attend Dev Academy, you may opt to defer to a later cohort.


## Withdrawing from Dev Academy

If you have decided to leave the program, there are a few steps we ask you to take to do this.

**If you have not started Phase 0** yet, or are in the Week 0 module, please contact both
<admissions@devacademy.co.nz> and your Phase 0 facilitator to let us know of your decision.
