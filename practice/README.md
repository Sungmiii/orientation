# Get a head start

## Typing and Shortcuts
Don't underestimate the importance of your typing skills! It's important to be able to type at a decent clip in this new career you've embarked on! That said, it's not the end of the world if you struggle with typing, just take some time to practice, practice, practice!

- Take a baseline [test](http://www.typingtest.com/index.html) to see how fast you currently type.
- To learn the basics in touch typing and to improve your speeds, try either [typingstudy](http://www.typingstudy.com/lesson/1/part/1) or [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html).
- If you are already an accomplished touch typist, try [typing.io](https://typing.io/) to practice typing code, which has a ton of strange symbols.
- For shortcuts, try [shortcutfoo](http://www.shortcutfoo.com). You'll want to know about some of the awesome Atom shortcuts.

You need to be able to:
 - Type at least 40 words per minute
 - Use common shortcuts in Atom

## Command line
>Context: You'll be using the command line everyday. The command line is another way of working with your computer.Instead of working with windows,toolbars, menus and buttons,you're interacting with text. At Dev Academy we use iTerm (mac), babun (windows) and gnome (linux).

- [Practice the command line on Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
- [Read and follow along with learn python the hardway](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex1.html)

## Git and GitHub
During your Dev Academy experience (and for the most part of your web development career) you will be using Git and GitHub daily.

>Context: Git allows groups of people to work together on the same code, at the same time, without overwriting each others work. It is not Ruby, or JS, or C#. It is software that you download - a form of distributed version control which means it manages changes to a project without overwriting any part of the project.
>With over 10 million users, GitHub has become a social network for web developers - much like facebook or twitter. You build a profile, upload projects to share and connect with other users by “following” their accounts. And while many users store programs and code projects, there’s nothing preventing you from keeping text documents or other file types in your project folders to show off.
